A simple bottle tracker. User enters the contents and size of the bottle, then upon finishing can enter notes. All info is
automatically entered into a SQL table for easy tracking. Also will eventually be able to track diaper changes in a similar way, 
and access the data via modular pre-written SQL queries. Goal is a standalone app with a GUI that is quick and easy to use, even 
for non tech-savvy mothers who dont want to spend the time learning a new program. 

Current Features:
Track Bottles (automatically formatted to a SQL table)
View Bottles (currently can only view ALL bottles)

Usage:
Use in the terminal with "python main.py". Tables are created upon initial app startup. Valid commands are in "quotes".
